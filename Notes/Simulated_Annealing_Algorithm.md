### Principle
- gradual converge
- random search
- parallel
- population reinforce random
- adaptive
- loop
	- adaptive determine heat
	- random search

### Trick
- **adaptive determine heat**. if get better solve, slowly cool down until can't find a better solve, if no better solve, slowly heat up until find a new better solve or too hot.
- heat, determine search range and bad solve acceptability.
- population can make random more robust and efficient.

### Character
- global solve.
- parallel
- practical
- good parameters can bring high efficiency and high performance and high precision.
- random can be combined with heuristic info.
- population reinforce random, but **no communication among individuals**. basic difer between GA, Ants Sys...
