### Principle
- gradual converge
- random search
- parallel
- population reinforce random
- adaptive
- loop
	- adaptive determine heat
	- random search

### trick
- **adaptive determine heat**. if get better solve, slowly cool down until can't find a better solve, if no better solve, slowly heat up until find a new better solve or too hot.
- heat, determine search range and bad solve accepta
