# principle
- attribute
	- **type**, eg: int* .
	- **address**.
	- **value**, is value address.
- operation
	- *( p ) , get the **type** object at address **value**.
	- p = &( ) or address , assign address **value** to p. must same type or cast to same.
	- p-> same as *( p ). ,p must be a class.
	- 

# practice
- construction may fail, check if pointer is nullptr.
- circular reference
	- it's normal that 


# Smart pointer
