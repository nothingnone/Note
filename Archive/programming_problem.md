- problem
$$

\begin{gathered}
minf(X)=CX \\
AX+B \geq 0
\end{gathered}
$$

- principle
Minumum must at cross point of constraints. Solve space of constraints is a convex polygon zone in high dimension, so start from a valid point and search along constraint and normal vector of C, we will find minimum finally.
The key is how to implement search method with a high efficiency algorithm.----simplex method.
