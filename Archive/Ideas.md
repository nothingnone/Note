# Monte Carlo Method
## principle
**Transform** a problem into Probability problem. Use **random trail method** to solve.
## example
MonteCarlo Tree Search method used in Alpha Go. The point is to find the best next step.
So what is the best? The step that can leads to win.
the origin problem is transformed into **"find the best step that can leads to the most successes which is trailed by random steps."**^[Is this transform right? Maybe be not, but it seems that it is close to the answer.]
## summary
- this reminds that be clear that what is probability. In above, win probability
